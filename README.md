# CodeClauseInternship_Next-Word-Prediction
Next word prediction is a machine learning model designed to forecast the most likely word to follow a given sequence of words in a text or sentence. This predictive model is often built using techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer architectures.
